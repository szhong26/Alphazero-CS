# Introduction
This repository contains a single GPU implementation of Alphazero for solving the Compressed Sensing Problem. Given
a fixed matrix A(or unfixed), and an observed vector y = Ax, where x is an unknown k-sparse vector, Alphazero attempts to iteratively pick the k support locations of x.
